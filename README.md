NOTE: 
  I created this template using Vite and it doesen't change anythng 
  so if you use this template and don't want Vite than create the files
  needed and copy the code

To see the code i wrote in the crash course from video 3 - 7, 
look for a folder named Lessons and pick the folder with the
number according to the video your watching to view the code.
