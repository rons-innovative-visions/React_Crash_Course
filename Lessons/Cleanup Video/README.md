If you watched the YouTube Video you will notice that there's a components folder
I didn't go over because I needed extra files as an example in the Pages.

The components folder containers files such as the Navbar & Footer,
while the Pages folder pages such as an About page, etc.

You can always structure it as you like but make sure it makes sense when you do
